# mk
mk - file control system.

## Build
This package is provided for my project to resolve chicken-egg problem.
"mk" is supposed to be built anywhere and after it to be used to build other programs.
So there's no way you build it with itself.
Building give you one binary file "mk" and you should put it somewhere to run by hand.
### make
``
	% make
	% make strip # It deletes exceed symbols to make binary file less size.
``

This is a Unix port of mk,
originally done for the Inferno operating system.

Russ Cox repackaged this to build as a standalone
Unix program.  Send comments about packaging to
